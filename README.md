# Cell-Cell Connectivity Analysis
Modified from Litichevskiy et al. 2018 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29655704/) to calculate Connectivity between cell types under a single perturbation or across a class of perturbations.

### Step-by-Step
1. Similarity via Spearson **correlation**
2. Background-corrected correlation to get **Connectivity**
3. Clustering of connectivity to get cell-cell relationships under 
  a. a single perturbation
  b. a class of perturbations (i.e. kinase inhibitors)
4. Heatmap, Volcano plots, and Dendrograms
